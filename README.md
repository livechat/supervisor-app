# Supervisor

**Supervisor** is a simple widget helping you monitor the weekly progress of your agents and their availability. With **Supervisor**, you can check the list of available agents. Also, it shows the agents' basic statistics from the last 10 days.

The statistics include the following information:

- **Agent working time**
- **Chatting time**
- **Agent ratings**

# App setup

## Before you start

To use this application in your LiveChat dashboard, you'll need to create your own app in [Developer Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console) and get the **Client Id**.

## Getting started

1. Go to [Apps](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps) in [Developer Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console).
2. Click **New App** and give it an **App Name**.
3. Choose the **LiveChat** product as the product you want to build for.
4. Go to **Building Blocks**.
5. Add **App Authorization** and mark it as _JavaScript App_. Your **Client Id** will be displayed there.
6. Add `agents--all:ro` and `reports_read` scopes to the App scopes and API access box.
7. Fetch the **Supervisor** app repository.
8. In the app directory, do the following steps :

   - Install dependencies (`npm install`).
   - In your project, go to `src/utils/congif.js` and replace `client_id` with your own **Client Id** (the one from **Step 5**).
   - Run your app (`npm start`).

9. Add your app url (for example: `https://localhost:3000`) in these two locations:

   - **Redirect URI whitelist**
   - **Agent App Widgets**

10. In **Private installation**, click **Install app**.

You should now be able to use **Supervisor** with LiveChat.

# How it works

[Agent App Widgets](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-agent-app) are web applications loaded inside the LiveChat Agent App. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the Agentâ€™s App sidebar.

To get information such as tags, you need to use [Configuration API](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/management/configuration-api).

In order to pull data from our server, you need to include an **access_token** in all the requests. You can get it using one of the [agent authorization flows](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/authorization/agent-authorization).
