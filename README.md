# Supervisor

**Supervisor** is a simple widget helping you monitor the weekly progress of your agents and their availability. With **Supervisor**, you can check the list of available agents. Also, it shows the agents' basic statistics from the last 10 days. 

The statistics include the following information:

- **Agent working time** 
- **Chatting time** 
- **Agent ratings**

# App setup

## Before you start

To use this application in your LiveChat dashboard, you'll need to create your own app in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console) and get the **Client Id**.

## Getting started

1. Go to [Apps](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps) in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console).
2. Click **New App** and give it an **App Name**.
3. Select *Agent App Widget* as the **App Template**.
4. Go to **Develop -> Building Blocks**.
5. Add **App Authorization** and mark it as *JavaScript App*. Your **Client Id** will be displayed there.
6. Fetch the **Supoervisor** app repository.
7. In the app directory, do the following steps :

    * Install dependencies (`npm install`).
    * In your project, go to `src/utils/congif.js` and replace `client_id` with your own **Client Id** (the one from **Step 5**).
    * Run your app (`npm start`).
8. Add your app url (for example: `https://localhost:3000`) in these two locations:

    * **Redirect URI whitelist**
    * **Agent App Widgets**
9. In **Private installation**, click **Install app**. 

You should now be able to use **Supervisor** with LiveChat.

# How it works

[Agent App Widgets](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/) are web applications loaded inside the LiveChat Agent App. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the Agentâ€™s App sidebar.

To get information such as tags and canned responses, you need to use [LiveChat Rest API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/rest-api/).

In order to pull data from our server, Rest API requires you to include an **access_token** in all the requests. You can get it using [LiveChat Boilerplate](https://docs.livechatinc.com/boilerplate/) and [JavaScript Widget API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/#javascript-api).

You should also get familiar with [Authorization](https://docs.livechatinc.com/authorization/).

# More sample apps 
Experiment more with two different sample apps:
 - [Tag Master](https://github.com/livechat/tag-master) - widget for helping your agents manage tags and canned responses.
 - [Progress](https://github.com/livechat/progress-app) - widget for helping you monitor statistics of your team, such as chat ratings, response times, and chatting times.
